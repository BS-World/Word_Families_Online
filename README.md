# Word Families Online

Word Families Online is a realtime multiplayer game that consists of two players, one being a **director** and the other a **player**.

## How Does It Work?

**Word Families** are groups of words that have a common feature or pattern. In this game, two images of similarly sounding words flash simultaneously on both players' screen. One of the images is randomly highlighted only for the director to see. The director says the name of the highlighted image and the player hears what the director said one time, and then clicks on the appropriate image. The player will get points for correct answers, and for how fast it took him/her to click on the correct image from the time the player finishes hearing what the director said.
